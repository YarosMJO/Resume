      <h1>Hello, I'm Yaroslav Mykhailivskyi</h1>
      <p>
         I am very interested in getting to this course. Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
         So far I've been learning Java, but having tried a lucid and powerful C # I have decided to study it. 
         I really love working in a team and able to listen (but not always perceive ðŸ˜„) Now in my priorities improve .Net and English.
